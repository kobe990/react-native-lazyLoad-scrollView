## react-native-lazyLoad-scrollView
* This is a component of scrollView that it's inner view items are loaded auto.
* This component is based on the origin react-native component.
* When the component is rendered initially, it will load some data. When you scroll to the bottom, it will load another data.
* in the source code, we use the local file with .json as extension to mock server response data. You can use 'fetch' api instead of the mock approach in practice
